RUM HAM! RUM HAM! I'm sorry rum ham! I'm sorry... If you're in my room, you're always being filmed. Oh, get a job? Just get a job? Why don't I strap on my job helmet and squeeze down into a job cannon and fire off into job land, where jobs grow on jobbies?! Cat in the wall, eh?! Okay, now you're talking my language. Dayman, fighter of the Nightman, champion of the sun, you're a master of karate and friendship for everyone.
